# ITP_SE_Team13: AI-Driven Sport Analysis and Improvement System

## Project description
The objective of this project is to develop a Proof-of-Concept AI model using Computer Vision to identify key body parts and analyze golf swings from video footage. Additionally, the project involves creating a Front-End coaching feedback system. This system will provide golfers with detailed assessments of their swings, comparing them against established benchmarks of good swing mechanics. The ultimate goal is to help golfers improve their performance through data-driven insights.

## Scope
#### Video Analysis
- Utilize at least two perspectives (frontal and down-the-line) to identify crucial body parts relevant to golf swings (e.g., head, shoulders, arms, wrists, hips, spine, knees, feet).

#### Data Extraction
- Overlay a stick figure on the videos to extract frame-by-frame posture changes.
- Gather data on positions and angles for detailed analysis.

#### Dataset Creation
- Compile data from hundreds/thousands of textbook swings to establish benchmarks for good swing characteristics.

#### AI Model Training
- Develop a pre-trained model that can assess and categorize new swings based on learned parameters.

#### Keywords
AI, Data Analysis, Model Training

## Final deliverable(s)
- Proof-of-concept AI model capable of identifying key body parts and analyzing golf swings from videos.
- Dataset used for training the AI model.
- Front-end coaching feedback system for user interaction.
